FineTuned and Quantized LLM for Mental Health ChatBot using Q-lora

Overview

Welcome to the repository for the FineTuned and Quantized LLM (Large Language Model) for a Mental Health ChatBot using Q-lora. This project utilizes a custom fine-tuned and quantized LLM powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide responsive and accurate mental health support. The dataset included consists of 200 generalized questions that are suitable for replication in a medical diagnosis context, with precise responses outlined in an accompanying Excel sheet.

Features

Custom Fine-Tuned LLM: The chatbot is trained on a specific dataset tailored for mental health inquiries using the Q-lora framework.
Quantized Model: Implementation of quantization techniques to optimize the model for deployment on resource-constrained environments.
RAG-based Chatbot: Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance the quality and relevance of generated responses.
Excel Sheet Integration: Responses are structured based on a provided Excel sheet, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the chatbot's outputs.
Nadi Interface Compatibility: Questions are framed according to specifications detailed in the Excel sheet to maximize compatibility with the Nadi interface.
Dataset and Usage

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 200 generalized questions covering a wide range of mental health concerns. Each question is mapped to a specific response as detailed in the accompanying Excel sheet provided in this repository.

Usage Instructions


1.Setting Up Environment:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python environment setup with necessary dependencies. Detailed requirements can be found in requirements.txt.

2.Deploying the Chatbot:
Ensure the Excel sheet provided (MentalHealthChatBot (1).xlsx) is accessible and correctly formatted.
Configure the Nadi interface to accept queries as per the Excel sheet specifications for optimal performance.

3.Running the Chatbot:
Interact with the chatbot by inputting questions aligned with those in the Excel sheet to receive accurate responses.

4.Handling Beyond-Excel Queries:
Inform users that queries beyond those specified in the Excel sheet may not yield satisfactory results due to the chatbot's design scope.
